- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tnormanchs, you can call me Tres
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a new IT executive for a small Healthcare company called Crescent Health Solutions. We are what's known as a [Third Party Administrator (TPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_administrator).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all kinds of things, with a focus on general IT departmental practices and System Administration.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: here on github, [tres.norman@crescenths.com](mailto:tres.norman@crescenths.com) (marketing emails _will_ be automatically filtered and/or deleted)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him, Any/All (just be respectful and I won't worry about it)
- âš¡ Fun fact: Before this position I worked for a large healthcare corporation (which shall remain nameless) for approaching a decade (9/2015 - 8/2023) as a grunt worker, I am so stoked for the career track that CHS has presented me with.
